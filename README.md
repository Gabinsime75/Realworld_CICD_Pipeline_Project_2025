# 🚀 CI/CD & DevSecOps Projects Repository

This repository contains hands-on projects demonstrating **Continuous Integration (CI)**, **Continuous Deployment (CD)**, and **DevSecOps** best practices.  
The goal is to showcase end-to-end automation using industry-leading tools across the CI/CD ecosystem.

📦 Tools Covered
Build & Dependency Management

Maven – Java build automation and dependency management tool used for packaging applications and managing libraries.

Code Quality & Security

SonarQube – Continuous inspection platform for code quality, detecting bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

Trivy – Container and file system vulnerability scanner for detecting CVEs and misconfigurations.

Checkov – Static analysis tool for scanning Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Kubernetes, etc.) for security misconfigurations.

TFLint – Linter for Terraform to catch errors and enforce best practices.

Snyk – Security tool for scanning open-source dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

CI/CD Orchestration

Jenkins – Automation server for building CI/CD pipelines, integrating with source control, build, and deployment tools.

GitHub Actions – Native CI/CD automation platform in GitHub, useful for workflows triggered by commits and pull requests.

Argo CD – Declarative, GitOps-based CD tool for Kubernetes, enabling automated deployments.

Containers & Orchestration

Docker – Containerization platform for packaging applications into lightweight, portable images.

Kubernetes (K8s) – Container orchestration system for scaling, networking, and managing containerized applications.

Helm – Package manager for Kubernetes, enabling easy installation and management of complex applications.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Terraform – Infrastructure-as-Code tool for provisioning cloud and on-prem resources using declarative configurations.

Ansible – Configuration management and automation tool for provisioning servers, applications, and environments.

CloudFormation – AWS-native Infrastructure-as-Code service for provisioning and managing resources.

Monitoring & Logging

Prometheus – Monitoring and alerting system for collecting metrics and powering Grafana dashboards.

Grafana – Visualization platform for monitoring data and alerting across multiple sources.

ELK / OpenSearch Stack – Logging and observability stack for centralized log management.

Secrets & Policy Management

Vault (HashiCorp Vault) – Tool for securely managing and accessing secrets, API keys, and credentials.

OPA (Open Policy Agent) – Policy-as-Code tool for enforcing fine-grained access control and compliance rules.

📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a dedicated project that demonstrates a CI/CD or DevSecOps workflow.
Examples include:

ci-maven-jenkins/ → CI pipeline for Java apps using Maven + Jenkins.

cd-argocd-k8s/ → GitOps deployment pipelines using Argo CD & Kubernetes.

iac-terraform-ansible/ → Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and configuration with Ansible.

security-sonarqube-snyk/ → Code quality and dependency security scanning workflows.

🎯 Objectives

Automate builds, tests, deployments, and security checks.

Demonstrate GitOps workflows with Argo CD and Kubernetes.

Showcase Infrastructure-as-Code for cloud-native environments.

Apply DevSecOps principles (shift-left security, compliance, observability).
