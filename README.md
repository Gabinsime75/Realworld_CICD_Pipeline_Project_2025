# ðŸš€ CI/CD & DevSecOps Projects Repository

This repository contains hands-on projects demonstrating **Continuous Integration (CI)**, **Continuous Deployment (CD)**, and **DevSecOps** best practices.  
The goal is to showcase end-to-end automation using industry-leading tools across the CI/CD ecosystem.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Tools Covered

### Build & Dependency Management
- **Maven** â€“ Java build automation and dependency management tool used for packaging applications and managing libraries.

### Code Quality & Security
- **SonarQube** â€“ Continuous inspection platform for code quality, detecting bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
- **Trivy** â€“ Container and file system vulnerability scanner for detecting CVEs and misconfigurations.
- **Checkov** â€“ Static analysis tool for scanning Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Kubernetes, etc.) for security misconfigurations.
- **TFLint** â€“ Linter for Terraform to catch errors and enforce best practices.
- **Snyk** â€“ Security tool for scanning open-source dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

### CI/CD Orchestration
- **Jenkins** â€“ Automation server for building CI/CD pipelines, integrating with source control, build, and deployment tools.
- **GitHub Actions** â€“ Native CI/CD automation platform in GitHub, useful for workflows triggered by commits and pull requests.
- **ArgoCD** â€“ Declarative, GitOps-based CD tool for Kubernetes, enabling automated deployments.

### Containers & Orchestration
- **Docker** â€“ Containerization platform for packaging applications into lightweight, portable images.
- **Kubernetes (K8s)** â€“ Container orchestration system for scaling, networking, and managing containerized applications.
- **Helm** â€“ Package manager for Kubernetes, enabling easy installation and management of complex applications.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Terraform** â€“ Infrastructure-as-Code tool for provisioning cloud and on-prem resources using declarative configurations.
- **Ansible** â€“ Configuration management and automation tool for provisioning servers, applications, and environments.
- **CloudFormation** â€“ AWS-native Infrastructure-as-Code service for provisioning and managing resources.

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Prometheus** â€“ Monitoring and alerting system for collecting metrics and powering Grafana dashboards.
- **Grafana** â€“ Visualization platform for monitoring data and alerting across multiple sources.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** â€“ Logging and observability stack for centralized log management.

### Secrets & Policy Management
- **Vault (HashiCorp Vault)** â€“ Tool for securely managing and accessing secrets, API keys, and credentials.
- **OPA (Open Policy Agent)** â€“ Policy-as-Code tool for enforcing fine-grained access control and compliance rules.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each folder represents a dedicated project that demonstrates a CI/CD or DevSecOps workflow.  
Examples include:

- **`ci-maven-jenkins/`** â†’ CI pipeline for Java apps using Maven + Jenkins.  
- **`cd-argocd-k8s/`** â†’ GitOps deployment pipelines using ArgoCD & Kubernetes.  
- **`iac-terraform-ansible/`** â†’ Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and configuration with Ansible.  
- **`security-sonarqube-snyk/`** â†’ Code quality and dependency security scanning workflows.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Automate builds, tests, deployments, and security checks.
- Demonstrate GitOps workflows with ArgoCD and Kubernetes.
- Showcase Infrastructure-as-Code for cloud-native environments.
- Apply DevSecOps principles (shift-left security, compliance, observability).
